# CSCI468 Project

## Setup

You will require to build this project:
 -  Java Runtime Environment
 -  GNU C++ compiler (g++)
 -  GNU Make

## Running the Compiler Demo

First build the project using GNU Make:

```bash
$ make cleaner # cleans up previous build
$ make # recommend using the -j (for jobs) flag to increase build speed
```

To run the new build, now use the ./Micro script.

```bash
$ ./Micro source.file
```
